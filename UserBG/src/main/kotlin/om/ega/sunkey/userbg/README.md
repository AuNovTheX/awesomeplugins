# UserBG plugin
This plugin lets you use a custom banner without nitro.
For using custom banner please read this guide on here:
https://github.com/Discord-Custom-Covers/usrbg#request-your-own-usrbg
After requesting your banner please wait some time then go to userbg settings and click "Redownload Databases".
The time you need to wait is between 2-3 minutes after requesting.
Please do not ask for support in the aliucord server if your problem is related to banner requests.

This plugin is originally made by halal, i just fixed some things. If halal requests to merge this with his plugin, or delete this, i will do it.
TODO: fix apfp support.
