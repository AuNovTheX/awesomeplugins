After requesting your banner please wait some time then go to userbg settings and click "Redownload Databases".
The time you need to wait is between 2-3 minutes after requesting.
Please do not ask for support in the aliucord server if your problem is related to banner requests.

This plugin is originally made by halal, i just fixed some things. If halal requests to merge this with his plugin, or delete this, i will do it.
TODO: fix apfp support. I wont do this rn because apfp is still in dev and the invite is broken
